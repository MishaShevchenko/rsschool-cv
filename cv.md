### Code example:
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.
For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 
```
function squareSum(numbers){ 
  let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      result += (numbers[i] * numbers[i]);
  }
  return result;
}
```
